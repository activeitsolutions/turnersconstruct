# Jac is my Girlfriend. I love her very much!

Mwaaaah!

**Smooch**

She takes care of me. She is endlessly supportive. She loves me when I don't deserve it. She actively tries to enjoy things that she knows I enjoy. She laughs at my stupid jokes. She comforts me when I'm ay my lowest point. She is the best friend I could have ever hoped for, and she is the Best girlfriend on earth. I feel sorry for other people who will never know how wonderful a relationship can be. I think that I didn't really know what a healthy and good relationship was before I met her. She is the best. I can only hope that I am even a fraction as good to her as she is to me, because I'll never be able to match it (I will try my hardest though).

I love her more than anything. <3
